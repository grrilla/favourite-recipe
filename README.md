HTML/CSS/jQuery Exercise

12/07/2016

This exercise was performed as part of a prepatory course for a bootcamp. It emphasizes the use of some basic
HTML/CSS elements, onto which some stylistic CSS techniques are applied (i.e. transitions, tranformations, etc.). 
jQuery is used to allow user interactions to manipulate document elements.

The most sophisticated element is the "step-box" at the bottom of the page, which allows the user to step through
cooking instructions one by one by pressing a key. The code itself is not as clean as I would like it to be, but
is functional in its purpose.
