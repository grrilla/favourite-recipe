					This recipe is something I often enjoy as a staple since, while it is rich and flavourful, it is still light and versatile. In colder seasons, enjoy with steamed greens and roast vegetables; in warmer times of year, pair with a nice refreshing salad and fresh bread.

				<h2>Preparation</h2>		
				<ol>
					<h4>Salmon (30 minutes)</h4>
					<li>Preheat oven to 425&deg;F.</li>
					<li>Oil an oven safe, shallow dish and place fillets skin-side down with an inch of space between.</li>
					<li>Season evenly with salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, and half of your chopped dill weed. Rub lightly into flesh.</li>
					<li>Zest lemon, setting lemon zest aside, covered. Cut lemon lengthwise and into 1/4" slices ("sunrise" cut).</li>

					<img src="prepped.jpg">
				
					<li>Lay lemon slices in a layer atop fillets, providing coverage from direct heat. If possible, overlap slices to eliminate large gaps.</li>
					
					<p class="tip">					
						<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Looking for something to do earlier in the day? Prepare the filets to this point ahead of time! Simply cover and refrigerate until 30 minutes before meal time.</em>
					</p>
					
					<li>Once oven has reached temperature, bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked medium.</li>
					
					
					<h4>Sauce (10 minutes)</h4>
					<li>Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add white wine, bring to boil, and then simmer over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add whipping cream slowly into pan, stirring steadily. <strong>Do not allow cream to boil.</strong></li>
					<li>Add shallot, lemon zest, and the remainder of dill weed. Salt and pepper to taste. Simmer until thickened, stirring constantly.</li>

					<p class="tip">
						<em><strong>Tip:</strong> Not sure when the sauce is ready? Trust the wooden spoon! A wooden spoon is ideal for testing a cream sauce's consistency because of its grain. Dip the back of the spoon in your sauce and hold it over the pan - does the sauce coat the spoon or just run off? If it coats the spoon, you're all set!</em>
					</p>
					
					<li>Add salt, pepper, white wine or lemon juice to taste. Once satisfied with the flavour, remove sauce from heat and allow it to thicken on standing (~2 minutes).</li>
				</ol>

					<li>Garnish each plate with baked lemon slices and a sprig of fresh dill and serve.</li>
